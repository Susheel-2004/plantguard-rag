Hereâ€™s a detailed list of the most common fertilizers used in Indian agriculture, including their composition, how they help crops, and which plants typically benefit from each type:

### 1. **Urea (46% Nitrogen)**
   - **Composition:** Urea is a highly concentrated nitrogenous fertilizer containing 46% nitrogen (N). It is available in granular form and is the most commonly used nitrogen fertilizer in India.
   - **How It Helps:** Nitrogen is crucial for the growth of plants as it is a major component of chlorophyll, the compound that plants use in photosynthesis. Nitrogen promotes lush, green foliage, enhances vegetative growth, and is vital for protein synthesis.
   - **Crops Benefited:** 
     - **Rice:** Promotes rapid growth and improves grain yield.
     - **Wheat:** Increases tillering (production of additional shoots) and grain filling.
     - **Maize:** Supports overall plant vigor and ear size.
     - **Sugarcane:** Enhances cane length and sugar content.

### 2. **Single Super Phosphate (SSP) (16% P2O5)**
   - **Composition:** SSP contains 16% phosphorus (P2O5), 11% sulfur (S), and calcium. It is a water-soluble fertilizer that provides a steady supply of phosphorus to plants.
   - **How It Helps:** Phosphorus is essential for root development, flowering, and fruiting. It also helps in energy transfer and photosynthesis. Sulfur aids in protein synthesis and improves crop quality.
   - **Crops Benefited:**
     - **Pulses (e.g., chickpeas, lentils):** Enhances root development and nitrogen fixation.
     - **Oilseeds (e.g., mustard, groundnut):** Promotes flowering and oil content.
     - **Cereals (e.g., wheat, rice):** Improves root strength and grain formation.
     - **Vegetables (e.g., potatoes, tomatoes):** Boosts early root growth and yields.

### 3. **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP) (18-46-0)**
   - **Composition:** DAP contains 18% nitrogen (N) and 46% phosphorus (P2O5). It is a granular fertilizer and one of the most widely used phosphorus fertilizers in India.
   - **How It Helps:** DAP provides a balanced supply of nitrogen and phosphorus, which are essential for early root development, vigorous growth, and high yields. The nitrogen helps in vegetative growth, while phosphorus promotes root development and flowering.
   - **Crops Benefited:**
     - **Cereals (e.g., wheat, rice):** Supports early growth stages and improves grain yield.
     - **Pulses:** Enhances root nodulation and nitrogen fixation.
     - **Sugarcane:** Encourages root development and sugar content.
     - **Horticultural Crops (e.g., fruits, vegetables):** Promotes flowering and fruiting.

### 4. **Muriate of Potash (MOP) (60% K2O)**
   - **Composition:** MOP contains 60% potassium (K2O). It is a water-soluble, granular fertilizer that provides potassium in an easily absorbable form.
   - **How It Helps:** Potassium is vital for enzyme activation, water regulation, and stress resistance in plants. It improves fruit quality, shelf life, and resistance to diseases. Potassium also strengthens plant cell walls and enhances drought tolerance.
   - **Crops Benefited:**
     - **Bananas:** Increases fruit size and sweetness.
     - **Sugarcane:** Improves sugar content and cane strength.
     - **Potatoes:** Enhances tuber size and quality.
     - **Cotton:** Improves fiber quality and boll formation.

### 5. **Ammonium Sulfate (21-0-0-24)**
   - **Composition:** Ammonium sulfate contains 21% nitrogen (N) and 24% sulfur (S). It is available in granular form and is used both as a fertilizer and soil acidifier.
   - **How It Helps:** Nitrogen promotes vegetative growth, while sulfur is essential for protein synthesis, enzyme activity, and chlorophyll formation. It also helps in nitrogen fixation in leguminous crops and improves the flavor of some crops.
   - **Crops Benefited:**
     - **Tea:** Improves leaf growth and quality.
     - **Onions:** Enhances bulb formation and sulfur content.
     - **Garlic:** Increases bulb size and flavor intensity.
     - **Pulses:** Supports nitrogen fixation and protein content.

### 6. **Zinc Sulfate (ZnSO4)**
   - **Composition:** Zinc sulfate contains 21% zinc (Zn) and 10.5% sulfur (S). It is applied either as a soil amendment or a foliar spray.
   - **How It Helps:** Zinc is essential for the formation of growth hormones and enzyme systems in plants. It also plays a crucial role in chlorophyll production and carbohydrate metabolism. Zinc deficiency can lead to stunted growth and reduced yields.
   - **Crops Benefited:**
     - **Rice:** Corrects zinc deficiency and enhances tillering.
     - **Maize:** Improves cob size and grain filling.
     - **Citrus Fruits:** Prevents fruit drop and improves quality.
     - **Wheat:** Boosts grain yield and quality.

### 7. **Gypsum (Calcium Sulfate)**
   - **Composition:** Gypsum contains 22-23% calcium (Ca) and 15-18% sulfur (S). It is a naturally occurring mineral used as a soil amendment and fertilizer.
   - **How It Helps:** Gypsum improves soil structure by reducing compaction and enhancing water infiltration. Calcium is essential for cell wall formation and root development, while sulfur is vital for protein synthesis and enzyme activity. Gypsum also helps in reclaiming sodic soils.
   - **Crops Benefited:**
     - **Groundnut:** Improves pod formation and quality.
     - **Sugarcane:** Enhances cane strength and sucrose content.
     - **Potatoes:** Supports tuber development and disease resistance.
     - **Horticultural Crops:** Improves fruit quality and shelf life.

### 8. **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) (26% N)**
   - **Composition:** CAN contains 26% nitrogen (N) with equal parts of ammonium and nitrate forms. It also provides a small amount of calcium (Ca).
   - **How It Helps:** CAN supplies nitrogen in a form that is readily available to plants, promoting quick growth and green foliage. Calcium helps in root development and improves resistance to diseases.
