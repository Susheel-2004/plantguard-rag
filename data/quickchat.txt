    How often should I water my plant?
        The frequency of watering depends on the type of plant, its size, the pot, and the environment. Generally, you should water when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so ensure the pot has drainage holes. Adjust watering frequency based on the season, watering more in the growing season and less during dormancy.

    What are the signs of overwatering?
        Overwatered plants often show signs like yellowing leaves, soft or mushy stems, and wilting despite the soil being moist. You may also notice a musty smell from the soil or mold growing on the surface. In severe cases, roots may rot, leading to brown or blackened roots when inspected. To prevent this, water less frequently and ensure good drainage.

    How to deal with pests on plants?
        Start by isolating the affected plant to prevent the pests from spreading. Manually remove visible pests like aphids or spider mites using water, a soft cloth, or by hand. Apply insecticidal soap, neem oil, or a natural pesticide to the plant. Regularly check your plants for signs of pests and maintain plant health through proper watering, lighting, and feeding to make them less susceptible.

    When is the best time to repot?
        The best time to repot a plant is in the spring, during its active growing season. This gives the plant time to recover and establish itself in the new pot. Signs that your plant needs repotting include roots growing out of the drainage holes, soil drying out quickly after watering, or the plant becoming root-bound. Choose a slightly larger pot with fresh soil to give the plant room to grow.

    How to prune my plant correctly?
        Pruning helps promote healthy growth and maintain the shape of your plant. Start by removing any dead, damaged, or diseased branches using clean, sharp pruning shears. Trim back overgrown areas to encourage new growth, making cuts just above a leaf node or bud. Be careful not to remove more than one-third of the plant at a time, as this can stress the plant.

    How to prevent yellow leaves?
        Yellow leaves can be a sign of various issues, including overwatering, underwatering, nutrient deficiencies, or inadequate light. Ensure you’re watering your plant correctly, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Check the soil’s pH and nutrient levels, and adjust if necessary by adding fertilizer. Make sure your plant is receiving the right amount of light for its needs.

    What are common plant diseases?
        Common plant diseases include powdery mildew, root rot, leaf spot, and blight. These diseases often occur due to poor watering practices, overcrowded plants, or poor air circulation. To prevent disease, water at the base of the plant rather than from above, ensure good airflow around your plants, and remove any infected leaves or stems promptly. Using disease-resistant plant varieties can also help.

    Tips for growing plants in low light?
        Growing plants in low light conditions can be challenging, but some plants like snake plants, pothos, and ZZ plants thrive in low light.
